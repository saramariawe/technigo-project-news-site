# News Site

Hello!

This is my first project in the self-paced web development bootcamp. I'm not entirely satisfied with the outcome of the website, but I see it as a valuable learning experience and I look forward to improving with each new project. As John Dewey once said: "Learning by doing."

The assignment was to create a news website. My aim was to evoke a “travel - vacation mode – on” feeling. I began the process with basic planning using just paper and pencil, sketching out the initial structure of the site. Then I searched for a suitable main image, which would also help define the website's color palette.

When building the site, I started with simple elements—headers, div boxes, and some basic HTML structure. From there, I moved on to styling with CSS, where I added colors and adjusted the layout. I wanted the photo to be well-integrated and visually fitting with the rest of the design.

One of the final features I added was a drop-down menu. It’s just a basic button with a drop-down effect, but I’m proud of it since it's the first one I've ever created!

I used both Flexbox and CSS Grid, but mostly Grid, as I wanted the “small news” boxes to adapt depending on the device used.

I know I still have time to continue working on the site, but since this is my first project, I’ve decided to wrap it up here. I’m aware that I have a lot of room to grow in my web development skills, and I’m excited for what lies ahead.
However, I would improve the appearance of the 'small news' boxes to make them more appealing, and possibly adjust the color scheme as well.
